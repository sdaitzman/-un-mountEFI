(un)mountEFI
============

OS X app to (un)mount the EFI partition. Fast and simple.


useful for anyone using rEFInd/rEFIt and anyone mucking about with their EFI or developing firmware

open source

use however you want, on the condition that I am not responsible for anything that happens to you, your family, or the space-time continuum
and that you share-alike, meaning you have to include the above text, lines 9-14, from "open" to "installer."
also, I'd appreciate if you contact me, Sam Daitzman, at samuel@daitzman.com, but you don't have to.
this is not the real license. for the real, full, legally binding one, look in the PKG installer.
