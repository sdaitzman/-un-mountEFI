(un)mountEFI
============

This software is considered fairly stable but no longer under development - I still use it, and I've found it useful!

OS X app to (un)mount the EFI partition. Fast and simple to use. Useful for anyone using rEFInd/rEFIt and anyone mucking about with their EFI or developing firmware. Completely open-source. Developed and tested by Sam Daitzman, but feel free to fork or send in bugs/improvements.

# Installation:
1. Go to http://cl.ly/TASF and click download
2. When done, open .pkg file and follow instructions
3. There is no step three :)









# Casual (informal, non-legally binding) license:
use however you want, on the condition that I am not responsible for anything that happens to you, your family, or the space-time continuum
and that you share-alike, meaning you have to include the above text, lines 9-14, from "open" to "installer."
also, I'd appreciate if you contact me, Sam Daitzman, at samuel@daitzman.com, but you don't have to.
this is not the real license. for the real, full, legally binding one, look in the PKG installer.
